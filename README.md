### My Focus (^._.^)ï¾‰

I'm a front-end developer in training passionate about crafting clean, user-friendly websites. I'm currently studying responsive web development with Skillcrush, where I've completed courses in HTML, CSS, and Git.

### About Me  =^._.^= 

I graduated with a Master's degree in Digital Forensics and Cyber Investigation. Even so, when I made my first landing page, I knew that front-end development was for me! Now, I'm currently in Skillcrush's Break Into Tech Program, studying Front-End Development.
