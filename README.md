### My Focus (^._.^)ï¾‰

I love to focus on front-end development! I have pinned some projects below that represent my unique interests. 

### About Me  =^._.^= 

I graduated with a B.A. in Arabic Language, Literature, & Culture. I have worked in customer service for over 10 years. Despite this, it is not for me. I am interested in a career that allows me to use my imagination while creating something awesome! When I made my first landing page, I knew that front-end was for me!
